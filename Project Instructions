Getting Started

Setup: On first launch, you will be guided through a setup wizard to set your username and select a local directory for data storage.

Data Import: Use the import buttons in each relevant panel to load your initial data from CSV files. Key files include schedule.csv, sample_definitions.csv, and order_quantities.csv.

Customer Management: The PT Customers module is the single source of truth for all customer information. Ensure all customers are entered here with their correct name and unique Customer Code (e.g., "WSLH"). All other modules will dynamically populate their customer lists from this central location.

Core Workflows

Future Planning: Use the Future Specifications panel to plan for upcoming years. When creating a new spec, select a customer from the dropdown (pulled from the PT Customers module) and copy the structure from one of their historical events. The system will provide an intelligent quantity forecast for each sample based on historical trends.

Optimization: Within the Future Specifications "View/Edit" modal, use the "ðŸ’¡ Suggestions" button for any sample. The system will suggest cost-saving opportunities based on a strict exact ABO/Rh match rule, respecting all previously made allocations to ensure resources are never double-booked.

Reporting: Use the Reporting panel to generate detailed reports, such as the "Annual Cost Analysis," which breaks down expenditures by category.
