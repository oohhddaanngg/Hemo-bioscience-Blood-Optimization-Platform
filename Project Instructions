This document provides a general overview of how to interact with the platform.

Getting Started

Setup: On first launch, you will be guided through a setup wizard to set your username and select a local directory for data storage. This is a one-time process.

Data Import: Use the import buttons in each relevant panel to load your initial data from CSV files (schedule.csv, sample_definitions.csv, historical_specifications.csv, order_quantities.csv).

Navigation: Use the sidebar to navigate between different modules.

Core Workflows

Planning: Use the Future Specifications panel to plan for upcoming years. You can create new specifications from scratch, clone existing ones, or copy the structure from a historical event. The system will provide an intelligent quantity forecast based on historical trends.

Optimization: Within the Future Specifications editing modal, use the "Suggestions" button on a per-sample basis to see opportunities for cost savings by using standing order overages or sharing with other PT events.

Inventory Management:

Use the Blood Suppliers and Vendors modules to manage your suppliers.

Log purchases for non-blood "Other Raw Materials" through the Vendors panel.

Track antibody lots and usage in the Antibodies panel.

Reporting: Use the Reporting panel (under "Analysis") to generate detailed reports on annual costs and other key metrics.

Daily Tasks: Use the Dashboard for an at-a-glance view of key costs and to manage your personal Case Study Tracker. Use the Manufacturing Calendar to view and manually add critical dates like "Earliest Bleed Dates".
