This document outlines the high-level principles and workflow for the Hemo bioscience Blood Optimization Platform project.

Project Goal
To create a web-based inventory management, optimization, and forecasting system to reduce Red Blood Cell (RBC) purchasing costs and waste. The platform is a decision-support tool, not a regulated document control system.

Technology
The platform is a self-contained, single-page application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Data is stored in the browser's IndexedDB and can be manually backed up to a JSON file.

Workflow
All development follows a strict four-phase process: Planning, Instruction, Code Review, and Implementation. This ensures a rigorous and well-documented development cycle.

Development & QA Philosophy
To ensure the long-term stability and reliability of the platform, all development work must adhere to the following principles:

No Hardcoded Data: All data presented in the user interface must be sourced dynamically from the APP_STATE object. Static lists in the HTML are forbidden.

Test on Load: A feature is not considered complete until it is verified to work on a fresh page load. Code reviews must include this step.

Review Holistically: When a function is changed, the entire feature area it belongs to must be re-verified to prevent regressions.

Context is King: A function's correctness depends on the context in which it's called. When a function's trigger point is changed (e.g., moving from an onclick event to DOMContentLoaded), it must be re-validated in that new context. The QA process must explicitly trace and test these new call stacks.
