This document outlines the high-level principles and workflow for the Hemo bioscience Blood Optimization Platform project.

Project Goal
To create a web-based inventory management, optimization, and forecasting system to reduce Red Blood Cell (RBC) purchasing costs and waste. The platform is a decision-support tool, not a regulated document control system.

Technology
The platform is a self-contained, single-page application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Data is stored in the browser's IndexedDB and can be manually backed up to a JSON file.

Workflow
All development follows a strict four-phase process: Planning, Instruction, Code Review, and Implementation. This ensures a rigorous and well-documented development cycle.

Development & QA Philosophy
To ensure the long-term stability and reliability of the platform, all development work must adhere to the following principles:

No Hardcoded Data: All data presented in the user interface must be sourced dynamically from the APP_STATE object, which is hydrated from the IndexedDB database on load. This includes customer lists, sample types, and any other data managed by the user. Static lists in the HTML are forbidden.

Test on Load: A feature is not considered complete until it is verified to work on a fresh page load. Code reviews must include this step. This ensures that the application's initial state is always correct and complete.

Review Holistically: When a function is changed (e.g., saveCustomer), the entire feature area it belongs to (e.g., the complete customer lifecycle) must be re-verified. This prevents a narrow focus on the immediate change from introducing regressions in related functionality.
