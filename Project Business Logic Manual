Blood Optimization Platform - Business Logic & Process Manual

Version: 2.0
Date: 2025-09-26
Purpose: This document is the authoritative guide to the business logic, data rules, and operational processes embedded within the Hemo bioscience Blood Optimization Platform. It is the single source of truth for all calculations and decision-making algorithms.

1.0 Core Temporal Logic


1.1 Unit Lifespan: An RBC unit has a maximum usable lifespan of 77 days from its bleed date.



1.2 Optimization Window: The valid window to use a unit for a specific PT event is between (Event Expiration Date - 77 days) and (Event Ship Date - 10 days). The unit's "Arrival Date" must be on or before the date it is needed within this window.



1.3 Standard Earliest Bleed Date: While the absolute maximum is 77 days, the standard target for an "Earliest Bleed Date" is 70 days prior to the event's expiration date. The 77-day window is used by default in the system to maximize sharing opportunities.


2.0 Blood Compatibility & Manufacturing Rules

2.1 Default Compatibility Rule (Automated Suggestions): For the purpose of manufacturing homogenous samples, all automated suggestions for sharing (both in the Future Spec modal and the BUP Generator) must be an exact ABO/Rh match by default. The system should not suggest using an O Neg unit for an A Neg sample.

2.2 Manual Override: The user retains the ability to manually override suggestions and assign compatible, non-identical blood types to handle special cases, such as creating mixed-field reactivity samples.


2.3 Antigen Homogeneity ("As Measured"): If multiple RBC units are required for the same sample, the units must have the exact same antigen phenotype for all antigens listed as "As measured" on the customer specification. This is a strict requirement.

2.4 Special Case - C3 Control Bonus Unit:

The C3 standing order includes a bonus unit specified as "Group O, Any Rh".

This unit is flexible and can be used to fulfill either an O Positive or O Negative requirement.

Locking Logic: The first time this bonus unit is allocated to a sample, its Rh type becomes "locked" to that sample's Rh type for the remainder of its volume. The system must track this lock and only offer the remaining volume to other samples with the same locked Rh type.

3.0 Overage & Volume Calculation Logic


3.1 pRBC Volume per Unit: One standard unit of pRBCs is considered to have 180 mL of usable volume.

3.2 Overage Tiers for pRBC Calculation: The system must use the following tiered percentages when calculating the required pRBC volume for an event:


Standard Overage: 10-15% (multiplied by 1.10-1.15).


DAT/Eluate Overage: 25-30% (multiplied by 1.25-1.30) to account for volume loss during washing.

3.3 Stateful, Volume-Based Allocation: The system must track all allocations in a central ledger (futureAllocations). When suggesting an overage unit (from a Standing Order or another PT Event), the system must first check the ledger, subtract the volume of all previous commitments, and only offer the true remaining volume. This prevents double-booking and allows a single large overage unit to satisfy multiple smaller needs.

4.0 Platform Vision & Scope

4.1 Decision Support Tool: The platform's primary purpose is to increase efficiency and support decision-making. It is not a regulated document control system. Its outputs (e.g., the BUP) are planning documents, not final, regulated manufacturing records.
