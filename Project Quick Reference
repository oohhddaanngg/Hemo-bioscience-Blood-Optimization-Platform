Blood Optimization Platform — Quick Reference Cheat Sheet
Purpose: One-page summary of business rules and logic for rapid development checks.
 Audience: Developers, testers, and AI copilots.

🩸 Core Rules
The 77-Day Rule
RBCs hemolyze at 78 days.


Standard: Expiration − 70 days = bleed date.


Optimization window: up to 77 days.


Event Windows
Earliest acceptable: Bleed − 7 days


Validation: Expiration − 77 days


Latest acceptable: Ship − 10 days

Physical Availability: Unit must be on-site (post-"Arrival Date") to be used.



🔬 Blood Type Matching
Default: Exact ABO/Rh required


Blank ABO/Rh: ANY acceptable


Blank antigens: ANY acceptable


Special Cases:
DAT Negative → ANY ABO/Rh


DAT IgG Positive → ANY ABO, RhD+ required


C3 Control → O Pos or O Neg



📦 Sharing Priority
Standing Orders FIRST
 (unused overage = wasted)


PT Events SECOND
 (schedules fixed, immutable)


Within each tier → logistics/proximity



🔐 Allocation Rules
No double allocation — tracked globally.


Normal allocation (✅): One unit serving multiple samples within same event.


Self-sharing (❌): Event donating to itself in PT-to-PT.


Multi-unit cohorts: All units must match phenotype when antigens specified; “as measured” antigens consistent across cohort.



📊 Outputs
BUP ranges: Show min→max overage.


Cell IDs: Always specify (HQC-1, HQC-2, C3-1, MQC-1, Korea-1/2/3).



🧬 Standing Order Reference
C3 Control: O Pos or O Neg


Hemo-QC:


HQC-1: AsubB Pos (RhD+ req.)


HQC-2: O Pos, R1r, Fya−


HQC-3: A1 Neg, rr


MQC/MQC-CAT:


MQC-1: A1B Pos


MQC-2: O Neg, rr, K+


Korea FFMU:


Korea-1: A1 Pos, R1R1


Korea-2: B Pos, R2R2


Korea-3: O Neg, rr



✅ Developer Checklist
Check event window (earliest / latest rules).


Confirm ABO/Rh & antigen compatibility.


Prioritize standing orders before PT events.


Prevent double-use in allocation ledger.


Verify multi-unit phenotype consistency.


Log decision in Decision Log.


Label allocation with exact cell.
