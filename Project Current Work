Current Task: Develop Overage Utilization Report
Phase: 1 (Planning)

Goal: Build the "Overage Utilization Report" using the new optimizationDecisions log to provide a comprehensive analysis of both realized savings and missed opportunities.

Key Objectives (this phase):

Create a data aggregation function to process the optimizationDecisions log for a selected year.

Implement the UI for the report, including summary metrics and two distinct tables for "Realized Savings" and "Missed Opportunities".
