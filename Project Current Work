### In Progress

- **Task 11 (Immediate Priority): Fix Critical UI Bugs**
  - **Description:** Address two high-priority bugs identified in v0.7.2.
  - **Bug 1:** Data (e.g., Sample Definitions) is not rendering on initial page load/refresh, but appears after a CSV import forces a UI update.
  - **Bug 2:** The "Add Customer" modal does not close automatically after a successful save.
  - **Target Version:** v0.7.3

### Next Up

- **Task 12 (High Priority): Future Spec Workflow Overhaul**
  - **Description:** Implement critical fixes and features to make the Future Specifications module fully functional.
  - **Requirements:**
    1. Fix the bug where manually created specs do not appear in the UI.
    2. Enable full editing of cloned specs (add/delete/modify samples, IDs, and types).
    3. Fix the "Copy Structure From" dropdown to display customer codes.
    4. Integrate the Future Specs module with the Blood Calculator.
  - **Target Version:** v0.7.3

### Backlog

- **Task 13 (Low Priority): Enhance Backup Filename Timestamp**
  - **Description:** The v0.7.1 fix for backup filenames included the date but not the time. This needs to be updated to a full timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS) to allow for multiple unique backups on the same day.
  - **Target Version:** v0.7.3
