Current Task: Plan Forecasting Logic Overhaul
Phase: 1 (Planning)

Goal: Redesign the forecasting algorithm for Future Specifications to accurately identify year-over-year trends, even when sample_ids contain the year.

Key Objectives (this phase):

Define a new sample_id normalization strategy to group related samples across different years.

Specify the trend analysis method (e.g., weighted average, linear regression) to be used on the grouped historical data.

Ensure the new logic correctly predicts quantities based on observed trends (e.g., growth or decline).
