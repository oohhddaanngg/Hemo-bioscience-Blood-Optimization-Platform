# Project Current Work: Hemo bioscience Blood Optimization Platform
## Focus: v0.9.1 - Hotfix for Initial Render Failure
Last Updated: 2025-10-02

---
## Roadmap & Task List

### In Progress
- **Task 21: [Implementation/QA] Hotfix for Initial Table Render**
  - **Objective:** Fix the blocking bug from the v0.9.0 QA review by ensuring the Order Quantities and Historical Quantities tables render their data on the first panel visit.
  - **Status:** Instructions generated. Awaiting implementation and external QA.
  - **Next Step:** Implementation by Developer AI; QA Review by ChatGPT.

### On Hold
- **Task 18-20 (Combined):** The feature and bug fix work for the v0.9.0 release is complete but not yet merged pending the successful hotfix from Task 21.

### Up Next
- **Task 17: [On Hold] Synchronize APP_STATE Version**
- **Task 10: [Planning] Create "Future Specifications" Feature**

### Completed
- **Task 16:** Platform Stabilization Post-QA Failure

# Project Current Work: Hemo bioscience Blood Optimization Platform
## Focus: v0.9.0 - Forecasting Tools & UI Bug Fixes
Last Updated: 2025-10-01

---
## Roadmap & Task List

### In Progress (v0.9.0 Release Cycle)
- **Task 18: [Implementation/QA] Overhaul Blood Calculator Module**
  - **Objective:** Rework the module into a forecast and sharing window analysis tool.
  - **Plan Summary:**
    - Redesign UI to use dynamic dropdowns for Customer, Year, Event, and Sample ID.
    - Implement a `normalizeSampleId(sampleId, customer)` function to handle inconsistent, customer-specific naming conventions.
    - Implement a new forecasting algorithm that uses the normalized Sample ID to aggregate all relevant historical data.
    - Implement a "Find Sharing Opportunities" feature that dynamically finds and displays other products/events with overlapping manufacturing windows.
    - Fetch and display the Earliest Bleed Date, Ship Date, and Expiration Date from the manufacturing calendar.

- **Task 19: [Implementation/QA] Fix Data Rendering in Quantities Panels**
  - **Objective:** Correct the bugs preventing Historical and Confirmed Order Quantities from displaying on initial load.
  - **Plan Summary:**
    - Investigate and repair the `updateHistoricalQuantitiesTable` and `updateConfirmedQuantitiesTable` functions.
    - The fix must ensure data tables are fully rendered the first time a user navigates to the panel, adhering to the "Verify on Load" tenet.

- **Task 20: [Implementation/QA] Fix Dropdown Logic and UI Inconsistencies**
  - **Objective:** Correct all reported bugs related to dropdown filters and UI elements across multiple modules.
  - **Plan Summary:**
    - Repair the cascading dropdown logic in the Historical Quantities, Order Quantities, and Historical Specifications panels so that Year and Event filters populate correctly.
    - In the Future Specifications panel, replace the "Year" text input with a dynamic dropdown and fix the "Event" dropdown to show real event names instead of hardcoded values.
    - The functionality of the working dropdowns in the Blood Calculator should be used as the model for consistency.

- **Status for all v0.9.0 tasks:** All plans are approved and detailed instructions have been generated. Awaiting implementation and a subsequent, comprehensive QA review.
- **Next Step:** Implementation by Developer AI; QA Review by ChatGPT.

### Up Next
