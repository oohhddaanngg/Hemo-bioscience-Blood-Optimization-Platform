Blood Optimization Platform — Project Current Work
📌 Current Version
Version: v0.3.8


Release date: 2025-??-?? (fill in actual release date)



🚧 Active Work in Progress
Future Specs display initialization bug


Specs not showing after page refresh.


Fix requires adding updateFutureSpecsList() call in data load and panel switch.


Antigen/antibody format migration for legacy data


Old string-based antigen/antibody data must be converted to array format.



🧪 Testing Focus
Confirm allocation ledger prevents double-booking.


Verify decision logging captures all critical events.


Validate multi-unit cohort consistency (same phenotype across all units).


Ensure Future Specs display persists correctly across refreshes.


Test legacy data migration to new antigen/antibody format.



✅ Recent Completions
Data persistence for Quantities CSV.


Blank specification handling (blank = "ANY type acceptable").


BUP output now shows ranges (min/max overage).


Standing order cell details (HQC-1, HQC-2, HQC-3, etc.) included in allocations.


PT-to-PT event sharing implemented.


Allocation ledger system introduced.


Multi-unit cohort consistency enforced.


Decision logging + Activity Log integration.


Year-aware BUP generation (customer/event/year now tracked).



🔜 Next Planned Work
Enhance Future Specs optimization algorithm.


Implement phenotype cohort tracking for multi-unit allocations.


Add cost analysis for antigen specifications ($35 per antigen).


Build enhanced reporting features (including BUP export).


Develop historical trend analysis.


Add vendor management module.

🗂 Version Changelog
v0.3.8 — 2025-??-??
Highlights:
Implemented allocation ledger system.


Added PT-to-PT sharing capability.


Introduced decision logging with Activity/Decisions tabs.


Enforced multi-unit cohort consistency.


Added year-aware BUP generation.


Details:
Fixed: Quantities CSV persistence.


Fixed: Blank specification handling (ABO/Rh/antigens = ANY when blank).


Changed: BUP output now shows ranges (min/max overage).


Added: Standing-order cell details (HQC-1, HQC-2, HQC-3).


Added: Allocation ledger with global tracking.


Added: Decision logging + audit trail.


Testing:
✅ OneWorld 4th 2025 pulls from HQC-2 & HQC-3.


✅ ISLA 3rd 2025 shares with HQC, Korea, OneWorld 3rd, Aurevia 2nd, API 3rd.


✅ Blank ABO and Rh specs accept any blood type.


✅ PT events share with each other (not themselves).


✅ Allocation ledger prevents double-use.


✅ Decision logging functional.



v0.3.7 — 2025-??-??
Highlights:
Applied HQC date-finding fix to Korea, C3, and MQC standing orders.


Removed global “first match” calendar searches — ensured matches remain window-specific.


Details:
Fixed: Calendar logic now only searches within event windows.


Fixed: Date matching logic corrected for Korea, C3, MQC events.


Improved: Event search functions more reliable across schedules.


Testing:
✅ Verified HQC/Korea/C3 events pull blood within allowed windows.


✅ No global bleed-date assumptions remain.



v0.3.6 — 2025-??-??
Highlights:
First critical bug-fix release addressing core platform stability.


Details:
Fixed: Quantities CSV now persists after refresh.


Fixed: Blank specifications now treated as ANY ABO/Rh/antigens.


Changed: BUP output now shows ranges (min → max overage).


Added: Allocations specify exact standing-order cell (HQC-1, HQC-2, etc.).


Testing:
✅ CSV persistence verified across refreshes.


✅ Blank ABO/Rh/antigen fields tested → accept all valid blood.


✅ BUP output validated with min/max ranges.


✅ Standing-order allocations labeled correctly.



v0.3.5 — 2025-??-?? (Baseline)
Highlights:
First functional version of the Blood Optimization Platform.


Contained critical bugs requiring immediate fix in later versions.


Details:
Issue: Quantities CSV did not persist after refresh.


Issue: Blank ABO/Rh specs not handled as “ANY acceptable.”


Issue: BUP output showed single values, not ranges.


Issue: Did not specify which standing-order cell was used.


Missing: PT-to-PT sharing — only standing orders were checked.


Testing:
❌ Data persistence failed on refresh.


❌ Blank ABO/Rh caused rejections instead of ANY.


❌ BUP outputs inaccurate (single values only).


❌ No PT-to-PT sharing tested.
