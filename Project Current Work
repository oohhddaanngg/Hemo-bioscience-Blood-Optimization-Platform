### **Current Task: Enhance "Historical Quantities" with manual and CSV data input.**

**Phase:** 1 (Planning)

**Goal:**
Develop the "Historical Quantities" module, which is currently a placeholder. This involves building the UI and backend logic to allow users to both manually input historical order quantities and upload them via a CSV file.

**Key Objectives:**
1.  Design and build the UI panel for "Historical Quantities".
2.  Implement a modal for manual data entry of a single historical quantity record.
3.  Implement CSV upload and parsing functionality.
4.  Create a table to display all historical quantity data with appropriate filters.
5.  Ensure data persistence within the main JSON data file.
