Version: 0.6.0 (Planning Phase)
Date: 2025-09-25

Current Task: Define Next Project Epic (Analytics & Reporting)
Phase: 1 (Planning)

Goal: Review the completed roadmap and define the scope and priorities for the next major phase of development, focusing on advanced analytics, reporting, and a new personal tracking module.

Key Objectives (this phase):

Dashboard Overhaul: Scope the implementation of dynamic, data-driven metric cards for costs (blood and antibody), antibody usage, and a new Case Study Tracker.

Reporting Module: Define the data requirements and layout for three critical reports: Annual Costs Analysis, Overage Utilization Report, and Supplier Performance Review.

Refine Project Vision: Solidify the platform's role as a decision-support and efficiency tool, explicitly excluding it from regulated document control processes.
