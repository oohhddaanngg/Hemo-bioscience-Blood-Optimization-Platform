Current Task: Plan Overage Utilization Report
Phase: 1 (Planning)

Goal: Define the data points, calculations, and layout for the "Overage Utilization Report," which will quantify the efficiency and cost savings from using standing order overages.

Key Objectives (this phase):

Identify the data sources needed to track overage usage (e.g., Future Spec optimization decisions).

Finalize the summary metrics to be displayed (e.g., Total Savings, Volume Utilized).

Define the columns for the detailed breakdown table.
