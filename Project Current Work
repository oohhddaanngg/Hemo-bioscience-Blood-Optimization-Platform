Goal: Perform end-to-end testing of the newly enhanced Future Specifications module to validate its functionality, accuracy, and alignment with the manual planning process.

Key Objectives (this phase):

Follow the official SOP to create, edit, optimize, and version several test specifications for 2026.

Verify that the intelligent forecasting provides accurate, trend-based quantity estimates.

Confirm that optimization suggestions are logical and that the "accept" workflow functions correctly.
