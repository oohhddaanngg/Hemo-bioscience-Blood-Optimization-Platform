Task 11: Fix Critical UI Bugs

Description: Address two high-priority bugs identified in v0.7.2.

Bug 1: Data (e.g., Sample Definitions) is not rendering on initial page load/refresh, but appears after a CSV import forces a UI update.

Bug 2: The "Add Customer" modal does not close automatically after a successful save.

Resolution: Released version v0.7.3 which calls all table rendering functions on page load and adjusts the saveCustomer() function to close the modal immediately after a successful save.

Version: v0.7.3

In Progress
Task 12 (Immediate Priority): Future Spec Workflow Overhaul

Description: Implement critical fixes and features to make the Future Specifications module fully functional.

Requirements:

Fix the bug where manually created specs do not appear in the UI.

Enable full editing of cloned specs (add/delete/modify samples, IDs, and types).

Fix the "Copy Structure From" dropdown to display customer codes.

Integrate the Future Specs module with the Blood Calculator.

Target Version: v0.7.4

Backlog
Task 13 (Low Priority): Enhance Backup Filename Timestamp

Description: The v0.7.1 fix for backup filenames included the date but not the time. This needs to be updated to a full timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS) to allow for multiple unique backups on the same day.

Target Version: v0.7.4
