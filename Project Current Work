Version: 0.7.0 (Planning Phase)
Date: 2025-09-26

Current Task: Update Authoritative Project Documentation

Phase: 1 (Planning)

Goal: Formally update all core project documents (Gemini Gem Instructions, Business Logic Manual, Project Instructions, etc.) with the latest business rules and clarifications derived from user feedback and newly provided documents. This ensures the project's single source of truth is robust and accurate before proceeding with bug fixes.

Key Objectives (this phase):

Integrate detailed logic for the 70/77-day rule, overage calculation tiers, and antigen homogeneity.

Codify the "exact match" compatibility rule for manufacturing.

Define the special "locking" logic for the C3 Bonus Unit.

Present the updated documents to the user for final review and approval.
