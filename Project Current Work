Current Task: Address Critical UI Fixes & Enhancements
Phase: 1 (Planning)

Goal: Prioritize and execute three critical user-identified tasks: adding a missing "Earliest Bleed Date" event to the calendar, fixing a major bug in the "Delete All Filtered Specifications" function, and improving the forecasting logic to be more intelligent.

Key Objectives (this phase):

Plan Calendar Enhancement: Finalize the plan to add the "Earliest Bleed Date" event type.

Diagnose & Plan Bug Fix: Investigate the deleteAllSpecs function to understand the source of the incorrect deletion count and plan the fix.

Scope Forecasting Logic Overhaul: Define the new logic for the calculateForecastedQuantity function to correctly identify trends across years from sample_ids.
