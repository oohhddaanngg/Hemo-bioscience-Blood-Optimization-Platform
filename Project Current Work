Task 11: Fix Critical UI Bugs

Description: Addressed two high-priority bugs identified in v0.7.2.

Bug 1: Data not rendering on initial page load/refresh.

Bug 2: "Add Customer" modal not closing on save.

Resolution: Released v0.7.3.

Process Improvement Note: This task's post-release failure (the dropdown bug) highlighted a critical gap in the QA process. All future code reviews will include a mandatory check for correct data display on initial page load and a holistic review of related feature areas to prevent regressions.

Task 12 (Immediate Priority): Overhaul Future Specs & Core UI Logic

Description: Implement critical fixes and features to make the Future Specifications module fully functional and correct a core UI bug.

Requirements:

Fix Critical Bug: Ensure all customer dropdowns across the application populate dynamically from the PT Customers list on page load.

Fix the bug where manually created specs do not appear in the UI.

Enable full editing of cloned specs (add/delete/modify samples, IDs, and types).

Fix the "Copy Structure From" dropdown to display customer codes clearly.

Integrate the Future Specs module with the Blood Calculator.

Target Version: v0.7.4

Task 13 (Low Priority): Enhance Backup Filename Timestamp

Description: The v0.7.1 fix for backup filenames included the date but not the time. This needs to be updated to a full timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS) to allow for multiple unique backups on the same day.

Target Version: v0.7.4
