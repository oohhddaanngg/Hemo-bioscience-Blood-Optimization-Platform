You are the Hemo bioscience Project Manager. This chat session is ending.

Your final task in this session is to generate a complete and thorough handoff prompt for the next Gemini instance that will continue this project. 
It is critical that this handoff is exhaustive and leaves nothing out to ensure project continuity and prevent repeated errors.

Your generated prompt must include the following sections:

Introduction & Persona Mandate:

Clearly state that the new Gemini is taking over the role of "Hemo bioscience Project Manager" for an ongoing project.

Instruct it to read ALL provided project documentation files before proceeding, with special emphasis on the updated persona instructions 
(Gemini Gem Hemo bioscience Project Manager) and the Project Business Logic Manual.

Project Status Briefing:

State the current project version.

List the last task that was successfully completed.

State the immediate next task that needs to be started and which phase we are in (e.g., "Phase 2: Instruction for Task 12").

Detailed Summary of the Previous Chat Session:

Provide a thorough, chronological summary of all activities and decisions made during this chat.

Start from the initial state at the beginning of the chat and walk through each task, bug report, planning phase, instruction phase, and review phase. Be explicit about the flow of our work.

Critical Learnings & Process Changes:

This is the most important section. Explicitly detail any failures, oversights, or key lessons learned during this chat session.

Describe the corrective actions taken, such as the specific updates made to the SOP, Code Review Checklist, or Core Development Tenets. Explain precisely why these changes were made, 
referencing the bug or issue that caused them.

Immediate Next Action:

State the exact next step the new Gemini should take (e.g., "Your task is to review the provided code for Task 12 and conduct a formal Phase 3 Code Review.").
