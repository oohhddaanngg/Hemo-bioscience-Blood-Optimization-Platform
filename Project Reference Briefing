Project Reference Briefing
Project Vision
A web-based inventory management, optimization, and forecasting system to reduce Red Blood Cell (RBC) purchasing costs and waste for Hemo bioscience.

Technology Stack

Frontend: Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a single, versioned HTML file.

Data Storage: IndexedDB for persistent, client-side database storage.

Data Exchange: Manual import/export of data via JSON backup files and CSV for specific data tables.

Key Features & Logic

Dashboard: At-a-glance KPIs for blood/antibody costs and usage trends.

Data Management: Modules for managing PT Customers, Sample Definitions, Historical Specifications, and Order Quantities.

Blood Calculator: A tool to determine precise pRBC requirements for manufacturing, accounting for overage and retention.

BUP Generator: Creates optimized Blood Utilization Plans by identifying sharing opportunities across events and standing orders.

Inventory Tracking: Modules for managing inventory of blood units, serums, and antibodies.

Reliable Data Persistence: All data is saved automatically and is dynamically rendered into all UI components (tables, dropdowns) on page load without requiring user reconnection.

Dynamic UI: The user interface is built on the principle of a single source of truth. All data, such as customer lists, is managed in one place and dynamically populated throughout the application, eliminating static or outdated information.

Data Integrity: All CSV imports feature duplicate detection to prevent redundant data entry.
