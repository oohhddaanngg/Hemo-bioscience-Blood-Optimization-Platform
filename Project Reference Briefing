Project: Hemo bioscience Blood Optimization Platform
Version: 0.7.0 (Planning)
Purpose: A standalone web tool for optimizing RBC inventory, forecasting needs, and reducing procurement costs. It serves as a high-efficiency decision-support tool, not a regulated document control system.

Key Modules & Current Status:

Dashboard & Reporting: Active. The dashboard displays dynamic cost metrics. The Reporting panel is functional, with an "Annual Cost Analysis" report and an "Overage Utilization Report" implemented.

Core Data Modules: Active. All core data modules (Customers, Samples, Quantities, Inventory) are functional. The PT Customers module is the single source of truth for all customer data used throughout the application.

Future Specifications: Active (Pending Bug Fixes). This core planning module features cloning, versioning, and intelligent forecasting. The optimization suggestion engine is undergoing a major overhaul to implement stricter, stateful logic based on newly clarified business rules. This is the highest development priority.

BUP Generator: Active. The BUP Generator is functional and will be updated to use the new stateful allocation logic to ensure its plans are always based on available resources.
